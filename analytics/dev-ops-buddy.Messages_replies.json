Could we take a moment to look into the root cause of these issues? Ideally, the PR should pass in the first attempt, so understanding what’s going wrong will help us avoid these repeated cycles.\n\nAdditionally, I observed that every time the PR is marked as “draft” and then moved back to “ready for review,” it retriggers the entire deployment on pre-prod along with all GitHub checks.

      "msg": "RCA Summary (In Progress)\nDuring both outages, we observed that individual pods were reaching 100% CPU usage at the very beginning of the incident. Correlating with the logs from `kube-events` in Elastic, we confirmed that the pods with high CPU usage were also experiencing liveness probe failures during that time. Below are a few SS samples from the incident window.\nWe identified a cascading failure pattern:\n• As certain pods hit 100% CPU, their liveness probes started failing.\n• This led Kubernetes to route traffic to the remaining healthy pods.\n• The increased load on these pods caused them to also reach high CPU, triggering their own liveness probe failures.\n• This repeated across pods, leading to a cascading failure.\nA day before the incident, we had updated the autoscaling policy to trigger at 65% CPU utilization. During the daytime load test, no issues were observed. However, it’s possible that, despite increased traffic, the pods were not scaling up effectively.\nUpon further investigation, we found that:\n• There were intermittent CPU spikes at the pod level, where usage jumped from 50% to 100% within seconds.\n• This spiky behavior was present earlier too, but after increasing the CPU utilization threshold to 65%, these spikes started consistently hitting 100%.\n• Because of the spiky nature of CPU usage, the HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) did not get a stable 2-minute window to trigger scale-out. This led to insufficient scaling during critical times.\nCurrent RCA Points and Action Items\n• We noticed that this issue is more prevalent in *Go-based services*, where CPU usage fluctuates by ±20%.\n• In contrast, *Java-based services* show relatively stable CPU usage, with fluctuations of around ±10%.\n• Due to this high fluctuation in Go services, autoscaling becomes unreliable unless:\n    ◦ A scheduled scaling policy is in place (as is currently done in the MP cluster), or\n    ◦ There is a sufficient buffer in CPU limits to prevent spikes from reaching 90%+ usage.\nWe are currently investigating the cause of this spiky behavior in the *ranking Go services*, and are also comparing this with other Golang-based services used at Meesho.\nTo complete this RCA, we aim to understand the CPU usage pattern end-to-end and determine whether this is a Go runtime characteristic, a code-level inefficiency, or a scaling misconfiguration.",

This happened because Ringmaster doesn’t perform a full ArgoCD app sync when using this update feature, it only updates the ScaledObject (HPA).\n\nArgoCD determines which scaling properties to apply based on the presence of the canary object. Since we had recently enabled canary (via values.yaml) but hadn’t synced the Argo app after enabling canary, the canary object (prd-gpmc-service) was technically present but in a MISSING state.\n\nRingmaster detected the presence of the canary object (in MISSING state) and used its min/max scaling values, and applying them to the main scaledObject (since canary was not present yet). Since the primary ScaledObject wasn’t present (also due to the lack of a sync), Ringmaster likely attempted to update it as well and failed though this error wasn’t handled, which led to the above issue.\n\n++ <@U06MFAMKYDP>",
